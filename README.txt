Tetris'd (version 0.0004)

I completed a couple of tutorial video series' on Youtube for Unity and was going to submit the outcome of those:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbm9lPB5GPw - Unity 3d: Simple First-Person Shooter Tutorial
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3HEFiDFApI - [Unity] 2D Platformer Tutorial

As I neared submission day though I wasn't happy with the majority of the code for these games being written in
 the tutorial itself.  I had added some sections myself for example a stamina bar in the FPS game, but not knowing
the specifics to why individual code sections were used hamstrung my ability to troubleshoot issues effectively
or truly understand wider reaching aspects of the code structure.

It was only at this point that I felt confident enough in Unity and the resources available online to attempt to
develop my own game.  I chose a Tetris base as I felt it was something I could work towards in the time available
and would still be usable as an incomplete game.  It would also not require any art assets allowing me to focus on
the code.

I've only included a compiled build for the web version, but the latest version is always playable on:

The individual releases are public and available on a github page:

Features I hope to add in the future are:
- Proper Tetris brick types!
- Next Block window in the upper right to display what is spawning next.
- Since the game wasn't intended to be playable seriously, I wanted to have the bricks start to get thrown around
	with the music at about 30 seconds in.  Sadly time didn't allow me to get this in for submission.
- High Score tracking with playername entry.
- Speed increasing with score.
